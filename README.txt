musicmaker.py is the main program.

tested with python3.7.1

generates random notes in a scale and writes to a musicxml file. Supports multiple parts, but only on bass clef piano. More instrument types will be added, and maybe treble clef support. The main file to run is musicmaker.py.

add custom scales in scales.txt

currently working on musicmaker 2; random chord progressions
